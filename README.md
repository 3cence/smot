### SMOT

Compile and Run on an X11 system, and select and area to screenshot.<br>
Requires: X11, scrot, and a composer (if you dont have one, use the option -n for no visual feedback)<br>
Usage: smot [options] dest_folder<br>
You probably want to set the dest folder, as the default is ~/Images/screenshots/ which is rather unusual<br>
NOTE: make sure your destination string ends with '/'. I did not spend the time to make it nice, as this<br>
is really just intended for personal use.<br>
[options]<br>
Use '-v' to get more information<br>
Use '-n' to disable visual feedback<br>
